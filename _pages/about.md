Greetings from New York City! This is Ufuk! And here's [my résumé](assets/pdf/Ufuk_Usubutun_Resume.pdf)

In my research, I start with real-world networking systems and protocols, then build the models that make sense of them. In doing so, I take a cross-layer approach. I have extensive experience interpreting standards in different realms (e.g. IETF, 3GPP, Open-RAN, Ultra Ethernet) and protocol implementations (e.g. Linux TCP). I conduct my experiments on networking testbeds (e.g. Cloudlab, Fabric) and I am experienced with analytical modeling of queuing systems. I am also experienced with network optimization.

Since the start of my PhD at NYU in 2020, I interned with *Nokia Bell Labs* (on routing optimization), with *AT&T Labs Research* (on 5G RRC Layer Modeling) and *Marvell Semiconductors* (on Ultra Ethernet Transport Protocols). I am also still actively involved with *AT&T Labs Research* as a research collaborator.

The [publications](https://ufukusubutun.github.io/publications/) page also contains pre-prints and presentation slides.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
