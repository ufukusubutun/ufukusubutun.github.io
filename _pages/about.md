Greetings from New York City! This is Ufuk! I am still building my personal & professional website! So please excuse the mess and check back again soon!

[My Resume](assets/pdf/Ufuk_Usubutun_Resume.pdf)

I am specializing in the analysis of network protocols (MAC and above) through analytical modeling and experimental evalutaion. Since the start of my PhD at NYU, I interned with Nokia Bell Labs (on routing optimization) and with AT&T Labs Research (on 3GPP RRC Layer Modeling). I am actively seeking an internship for Summer 2024!

The publication page also contains pre-prints and presentation slides.

Inspiring reads:

[Creating a Mathematical Theory of Computer Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220244226_Creating_a_Mathematical_Theory_of_Computer_Networks) by Leonard Kleinrock.

[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654) by Don Norman.
