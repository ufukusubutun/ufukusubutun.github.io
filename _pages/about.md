Greetings from New York City! This is Ufuk! And here's [my résumé](assets/pdf/Ufuk_Usubutun_Resume.pdf)

I am specializing in the analysis of network protocols and infrastructure through analytical modeling and experimental evaluation.

Since the start of my PhD at NYU in 2020, I interned with *Nokia Bell Labs* (on routing optimization), with *AT&T Labs Research* (on 5G RRC Layer Modeling) and *Marvell Semiconductors* (on Ultra Ethernet Transport Protocols). I am also still actively working with *AT&T Labs Research* as a research collaborator.

The [publications](https://ufukusubutun.github.io/publications/) page also contains pre-prints and presentation slides.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
